# Starting a project from scratch

All Model&#8239;W projects are structured according to the principles explained
in the [Architecture](./architecture.md) part. The simplest way to respect that
when creating a project from scratch is to use the
[Project Maker](https://github.com/ModelW/project-maker).

In a nutshell, you can start a project with the following command line:

```bash
curl -s https://pypi.run/modelw-project-maker/model_w.project_maker | python3.12
```

This will ask you a few questions and then create a project for you. You can
then follow the instructions given by the tool.

To know more:

-   It all leans on the
    [Django preset](https://modelw-django-preset.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and
    the overall [Architecture](./architecture.md)
-   The details of how to get started with the projects are listed in the
    [Project Maker](https://github.com/ModelW/project-maker) repo
